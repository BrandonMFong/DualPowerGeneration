Abstract:
With the worldâ€™s increasing population there is an
increase in daily required energy. By 2050 the
population is expected to rise to 9.7 billion, which
would be an increase of 2 billion people from our
present time. Earth itself cannot change in a way to
provide the needed energy to supply the services to
satisfy social and economic development, welfare and
health. With the use of renewable energy resources we
can help supply the energy demand for future
generations. The renewable resources that will be
reviewed includes: Solar and Wind power generation.


Project Description:
The wind turbines near the track/highways will be harvesting the wind energy while a train or car is passing by. In case there is no train or car passing by, solar panels will be mounted on the wind turbines in order to harvest solar energy.  For maximum energy efficiency, we will be using a bidirectional power converter in order to convert from DC-DC and DC-AC. After the energy is converted, a lithium ion battery will be used to store the renewable energy.
