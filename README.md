# Project Title

With the worldâ€™s increasing population there is an increase in daily required energy. By 2050 the population is expected to rise to 9.7 billion, which would be an increase of 2 billion people from our present time. Earth itself cannot change in a way to provide the needed energy to supply the services to satisfy social and economic development, welfare and health. With the use of renewable energy resources we can help supply the energy demand for future generations. The renewable resources that will be reviewed includes: Solar and Wind power generation.
