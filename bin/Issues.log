Issue: System.File has no close attribute
    Fix commit: fe17ea1
    Notes:
        - Log works fine though
        - I think because I am archiving all the written files and getting all the writting in progress
            - This is true.  I manually transferred over and query executed. 
            - I think I need to have a check in the insert data script.
                - Should I sync? or have check?
                    - putting a check is better
    Post:
        - The issue was the script I made on my machine will send empty files
        - on the insert_data.sh there is a check for empty files but it was misplaced. It was nested
            - I moved it outside the if statement
