Issue: System.File has no close attribute
    Fix commit:
    Notes:
        - Log works fine though
        - I think because I am archiving all the written files and getting all the writting in progress
            - This is true.  I manually transferred over and query executed. 
            - I think I need to have a check in the insert data script.
                - Should I sync? or have check?
