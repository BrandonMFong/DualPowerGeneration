Getting this error when running sudo python3 Main.py:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Main.py", line 13, in <module>
    import MaxPower_Classes
  File "/home/brandonmfong/SOURCES/Repo/DualPowerGeneration/MaxPowerTracker/MaxPower/MaxPower_Classes.py", line 18, in <module>
    RPi.init();
  File "/home/brandonmfong/SOURCES/Repo/DualPowerGeneration/MaxPowerTracker/MaxPower/IO.py", line 57, in init
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD);
ValueError: A different mode has already been set!

Notes:
  - I feel like IO.RPi_Handler.init() has been called already and has already set the GPIO to GPIO.BOARD
  - Try to find somewhere in the code that has this
  - Removing the init() in MaxPower_Classes didn't work
    - Now it is erroring on IO reference (see below)

    GPIO.add_event_detect(InfraredInput, GPIO.RISING);
RuntimeError: Conflicting edge detection already enabled for this GPIO channel

Notes:
    - Not entirely sure what this error is about
    - From the looks of it, it is not excepting my config on GPIO.RISING


- I may know what is happening.  The imports/modules in IO
- I know I had to import some files when running adafruit's test
